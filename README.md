# Screenshot-Browser-Extension

A simple UI browser extension designed to leverage HTML2Canvas JS library with a basic UI. I built this for a simple need to take snippets as screenshots through a device that doesn't support browser extensions and too painful to take screenshots with, followed by cropping. 

Works on mobile devices if you have a browser that supports extensions. If your device doesn't support it and you are using Android, checkout the Kiwi Browser which allows access to Chromium's Developer Tools and ability to use extensions.
